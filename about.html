	So many peoples are having problems related to working Web-Site and some of them don't know how to make a website. If you have searched YouTube for " How to make a website " you will get numbers of result but no one is there to tell you how to make website. They will tell you a program of HTML and compilation part of that program in paticular browser. Even a student of class XI can also able to make this kind of programs of HTML program but you can't say that program is website because it's runing in browser.<br>
	      We have searched many website on Google for "how to create a website" but we can't find anything but pramotion of that praticular website, some of them are paid classes they will give you knowledge about HTMl , advantages and placements through classes. After the study of HTML, CSS and PHP we thought about working project. So here we are with our first working project.<br>
	             It took seravel days to search about topic then an idea stuck into the mind we have faced some problems it may be similar with others also so we decided to build a website to solve problems you are facing related to website. If you want readymade website contact me.
